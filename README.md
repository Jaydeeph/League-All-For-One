# League: All For One

## Introduction
You know the times where your friends just want to start playing, but you really need to pee! They start the game and you miss the Accept match or miss the champion selection so now you have a 5 minute penalty. We've all been there. I wanted to start this project only as a simple "auto accept", but slowly built into something bigger.
Currently I'm using OpenCV For C#; using template matcing with the method ((CV_TM_CCOEFF_NORMED) no idea what's the different in methods at the moment). 

## Features
- Start league client (Provide location for LeagueClient.exe).
- Login (Provide username/password (password can be encrypted)).
- Create a match (Summoner's Rift || ARAM).
- Accept matches.
- Select champion (Provide champion name).
- Lock champion.
- Use image recognition method or manually by adding coordiantes for each.
- Test your ping for different regions.
